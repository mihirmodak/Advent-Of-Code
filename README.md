# Avdent of Code 2015

I am working through the 2015 edition of the Advent of Code in C++ (C++ 20).

The code for each day is located in its specific file. Each folder contains a `.cpp` and a `data.txt` file. The `data.txt` file contains the data provided by the Advent of Code website, while the `.cpp` file contains my implementation of the solution.

Solutions to the individual parts for a given problem are located in the same file, but have their results print out separately.

Descriptions of each problem can be found on the [Advent of Code 2015 website](https://adventofcode.com/2015).
