# The Advent of Code

The 'Advent of Code' is an Advent calendar for programmers -- counting down the days to Christmas through coding problems. Every year, I aim to complete the Advent of Code challenges while learning a new programming language. 

With the 2017 version of the challenge, I was learning `Python`, and in 2018 I was learning `R`.

With the 2015 edition, I am currently learning `C++`. 

And with the latest 2022 iteration, I'm aiming to learn `Javascript`.

Hopefully in the future, I can work with `Rust`, `C#`, `Julia`, and `Lua`.

So that's how the challenge works. Each year is a different branch in this repository, and a different language that I've learned. And each branch is labelled with the corresponding year and the language that was used.
