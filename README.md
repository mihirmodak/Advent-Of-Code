# Avdent of Code 2015

I am working through the 2015 edition of the Advent of Code in C++ (C++ 17).

The code is structured with a primary `main.cpp` file and a `data/` directory.

The `data/` directory contains the input daya for each day's challenges as text files (e.g. `day1.txt` has the input data for both Part 1 and Part 2 of the Day 1 challenge).

The `main.cpp` file houses a simple `main()` function to call a particular day's solution, as well as individual solutions for all the different days (e.g. `day1()` houses the solution to the challenge on day 1). These solution functions import data from the respective files in the `data/` directory

Solutions to the individual 2 parts for a given day are located in the same method, but have their results print out separately.

Descriptions of each problem can be found on the [Advent of Code 2015 website](https://adventofcode.com/2015).
