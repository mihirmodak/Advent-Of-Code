# The Advent of Code

The 'Advent of Code' is an Advent calendar for programmers -- counting down the days to Christmas through coding problems. Every year, I aim to complete the Advent of Code challenges while learning a new programming language. Every challenge set (i.e. every year's challenges) are in a separate branch in this repository.

Here's the index of Advent challenges I have started in the past:
